**User:**

Expand current roadmap and add specifying conversation folder on of the first priorities right now. Secondly, if the conversation folder already exists, but hidden in the git with .gitignore, the project still have to add all the conversations in the context to avoid memory loss.

```

**Handling Ignored Conversation Folder (`.gitignore`):**

Currently, InsightCoder saves conversations in the `project_info/conversations` directory, which is within the project path. If a user adds `project_info/conversations` to their `.gitignore` (which is a good practice to avoid tracking conversation history in Git), the current implementation should still work correctly for *loading* existing conversations.

**Reasoning:**

*   **`os.walk` and File System Access:**  The conversation loading logic in `ui.py` and `chat_utils.py` uses standard Python file system operations (`os.path.join`, `glob.glob`, `open`, `os.makedirs`, etc.). These operations are not directly affected by `.gitignore`. `.gitignore` only instructs Git *which files to ignore for version control purposes*.
*   **No Git Commands for Conversation Loading:**  InsightCoder's conversation loading process does *not* use any Git commands. It directly accesses the file system to read and write conversation files.

**Verification and Potential Improvements (Optional):**

1.  **Verify Current Behavior:**
    - Add `project_info/conversations` to your project's `.gitignore` file.
    - Run InsightCoder and have a conversation.
    - Close and restart InsightCoder.
    - Check if the conversation history is still loaded correctly. It *should* be.

2.  **Explicitly Handle `.gitignore` (Optional Enhancement - if needed for clarity or robustness):**
    - While not strictly necessary, you could add a comment in the code (e.g., in `MainWindow.__init__` where `conversation_dir` is set) to explicitly state that:
      ```python
      self.conversation_dir = os.path.join(project_path, "project_info", "conversations")
      os.makedirs(self.conversation_dir, exist_ok=True) # Create if not exists, .gitignore may exclude this

      # Conversation files are loaded from this directory even if it's ignored by Git (via .gitignore).
      # This is intentional to preserve conversation history locally without tracking it in version control.
      ```
    - This comment would serve as documentation for developers maintaining the code, clarifying the intended behavior regarding `.gitignore`.

**For the "Conversation Folder Control" roadmap item, you'll need to implement:**

1.  **Mechanism to Specify Conversation Folder:**
    -  **Command-line Argument:**  Add a new command-line argument (e.g., `--conversation-path`) to `ask.py` that users can use to specify a custom directory for conversations.
    -  **Configuration File (Optional):**  For more persistent configuration, you could consider a configuration file (e.g., `config.ini`, `config.json`) where users can set the conversation path and other preferences.

2.  **Update `ui.py` to Use Specified Path:**
    -  Modify `MainWindow.__init__` to:
        -  Read the conversation path from the command-line argument (or config file if implemented).
        -  Use this path to set `self.conversation_dir` instead of the default `"project_info/conversations"`.

By implementing these roadmap updates, you'll provide users with more control over conversation storage and further enhance the project's organization and user experience. Let me know if you'd like help with the code changes for the "Conversation Folder Control" feature!



**User:**

Also add to the roadmap the ability to automatically apply diffs. It should work this way: If ```diff ``` section is detected in the output text and the file that is subject to change exists in the project, the pop-up window appears with message "Would you like to apply this changes to the {file_path} file?" and the text area showing original code and the changed one exactly as it is in VSCode.

I've added a new section "**Automated Diff Application (Initial Stage)**" under "Medium-Term Goals" and broken it down into smaller, actionable steps.  This clarifies the scope of this feature and provides a starting point for implementation.  Remember to update the `ROADMAP.md` file in your project with this content.
