The conversation began with the user requesting a history of the InsightCoder project, initially in a blog post format. After feedback on the tone and accuracy, the AI provided a more professional, story-driven history acknowledging the project's origin from the user's personal "Anagnorisis" project and comparing its utility to tools like Copilot regarding context window limitations. This led the user to identify a critical need: managing conversational memory to prevent exceeding the LLM's context window with redundant information. The user proposed a RAG-like solution: summarize past conversations, include only summaries in the main context, and allow the AI to request the full conversation file via a special command or tool call if needed. The AI agreed this was a valuable approach and provided a detailed multi-phase plan to implement this RAG-based conversational memory management system.
