This conversation focuses on the future development of the InsightCoder project after publishing v0.1.1.

1.  **User's initial query:** Asked for next steps and improvement ideas.
2.  **AI's initial response:** Provided a categorized list of ideas (documentation, UI/UX, code cleanup, code modification suggestions, deeper code analysis, etc.).
3.  **User's key follow-up:** Proposed creating a `roadmap.md` file and, most significantly, enabling the AI to suggest code changes automatically via Git pushes using a separate GitHub account, asking for implementation ideas.
4.  **AI's detailed response:** Agreed to the roadmap, provided a proposed structure for `roadmap.md` incorporating short, medium, and long-term goals (including the Git push feature), and outlined a phased implementation plan for the Git push capability, emphasizing user review, security, and technical steps.
