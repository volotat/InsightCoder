Let's remove from the roadmap things that has already been implemented and clean it up to better represent visually the changes that are gonna be implemented at first: conversation folder control and diff integration through a pop-up window.

Here is the cleaned-up `ROADMAP.md` content. I've:

- **Removed completed items** from the "Short-Term Vision" that were implemented in `v0.1.2` (like visual loading indicator, error handling improvements, license, contributing/support sections, privacy warning clarification in documentation, and code cleanup).
- **Kept documentation improvements** related to explaining conversation history, context window, token usage, example prompts, and troubleshooting section, as these are still relevant and ongoing documentation tasks.
- **Highlighted "Conversation Folder Control" as "High Priority"** within UI/UX Enhancements.
- **Highlighted "pop-up confirmation dialog" as "High Priority & Crucial"** within "Automated Diff Application" in Medium-Term Goals, to emphasize its immediate importance for the diff feature.
- **Reorganized items slightly for better visual flow and readability.**

Make sure to update your `ROADMAP.md` file with this content. This version is more focused on the features you want to prioritize for the next steps.



**User:**

Why do you dublicate changes?



**Model:**

You are absolutely right to point that out!  That's a mistake on my part.  There is indeed a duplication of the "UI Confirmation Dialog" item in the `ROADMAP.md` under "Automated Diff Application".

My apologies for that redundancy. It seems that during the process of refining and adding emphasis to the "pop-up confirmation dialog" as "High Priority & Crucial", I accidentally left the original, less emphasized bullet point in place instead of replacing it.

**The duplicated line is:**

```markdown
        *   [ ] **UI Confirmation Dialog:** Create a pop-up dialog in the UI that appears when a diff is detected, asking the user "Would you like to apply these changes to `{file_path}` file?".
```

This line is redundant because the line directly above it already describes the same task, but with added emphasis:

```markdown
        *   [ ] **High Priority & Crucial:**  Implement a **pop-up confirmation dialog** in the UI that appears when a diff is detected, asking the user "Would you like to apply these changes to `{file_path}` file?".
```

**To fix this, we should remove the redundant, non-emphasized line.**

**Here's the corrected "Automated Diff Application (Initial Stage)" section for your `ROADMAP.md`:**

```markdown
     *   **Automated Diff Application (Initial Stage):**
        *   [ ] **Diff Detection:** Implement logic to automatically detect code diff blocks within the AI's responses. *(Look for Markdown code blocks with "diff" or similar language hints)*.
        *   [ ] **File Path Extraction & Validation:**  Extract the file path from the detected diff and validate that the file exists in the analyzed project.
        *   [ ] **High Priority & Crucial:**  Implement a **pop-up confirmation dialog** in the UI that appears when a diff is detected, asking the user "Would you like to apply these changes to `{file_path}` file?".
        *   [ ] **Visual Diff Display (Basic):** Display the code diff in the confirmation dialog, ideally with a side-by-side or clear visual representation of the changes *(similar to a simplified VS Code diff view)*.
        *   [ ] **Apply Diff on User Confirmation:** If the user confirms, implement the functionality to automatically apply the detected diff to the specified file in the project.
```

**Please update your `ROADMAP.md` file by removing the extra "UI Confirmation Dialog" line.**

Thank you for catching this duplication! It's important to keep the roadmap clear and concise. Let me know if you spot any other issues, and I appreciate your attention to detail!
