**User:**

We need to simplify the Readme.md and remove all the unnecessery bs from it.



**Model:**

Of course. I've streamlined `README.md` to be more concise and direct, removing verbose descriptions and redundant sections while retaining all essential information.

Here is the simplified `README.md`:

# InsightCoder

**InsightCoder** is a local, AI-powered command-line tool that gives you deep insights into your codebases. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), you can ask complex questions about any Git repository—whether it's code, documentation, or a book—and get intelligent, context-aware answers.

It was born out of the need for a powerful codebase analysis tool during the development of the [Anagnorisis project](https://github.com/volotat/Anagnorisis).

**⚠️ Important Privacy Notice**: InsightCoder sends your project's source code to an external LLM service (Google Gemini) for analysis. **Do not use this tool on repositories containing personal, confidential, or sensitive information.**

## Core Features

*   **Holistic Project Analysis:** Analyzes your entire Git repository, including uncommitted changes, to provide comprehensive context.
*   **Persistent Memory:** Saves conversation summaries to maintain context across sessions, enabling follow-up questions.
*   **Large Context Models:** Uses LLMs with large context windows (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) to understand complex projects.
*   **Interactive Chat UI:** A simple terminal-based UI for asking questions and receiving Markdown-formatted responses with syntax highlighting.
*   **Real-time Token Counter:** Helps you monitor the context size of your conversation.
*   **Diff Detection:** Automatically detects `diff` blocks in AI responses, paving the way for future automated code application.

## InsightCoder vs. GitHub Copilot

InsightCoder complements tools like GitHub Copilot. They serve different primary purposes:

| Feature             | InsightCoder                                  | GitHub Copilot                                  |

 ## InsightCoder vs. GitHub Copilot: Key Differentiators
 
-**Understanding Context Window & Token Usage:** InsightCoder leverages a large context window (up to 2 million tokens) to analyze your entire codebase and conversation history. **Tokens** are units of text that LLMs process. The context window size limits the amount of text the AI can "remember" at once. By keeping conversation history and codebase context within this window, InsightCoder provides informed and consistent answers. You can monitor token usage in real-time in the UI to understand context consumption.

### `CHANGELOG.md` Update

Here is the new entry for `CHANGELOG.md`. I will add it to the top of the file.

```markdown
## [v0.1.5] - 2025-05-15

### Added
- **Conversation Summarization:** Implemented an intelligent system to automatically summarize conversations using the LLM. This provides long-term memory while significantly reducing the token count sent to the model, making context management more efficient and cost-effective.
- **`SummaryWorker`:** Introduced a new background thread in `ask_src/worker.py` to handle conversation summarization asynchronously. This ensures the UI remains responsive while summaries are being generated after a conversation is saved.
- **Startup Summarization:** Added logic to `ask.py` that automatically detects and summarizes any previously unsummarized conversation files when the application starts. This ensures all history is processed into efficient summaries before the chat session begins.
- **`.gitignore` Integration:** The `get_codebase` function now respects `.gitignore` rules by using the `git check-ignore` command, leading to a more accurate and relevant codebase context.
- **`reconstruct_markdown_history`:** A new helper function in `chat_utils.py` to convert saved conversation data back into a full markdown string, which is necessary for the summarization process.

### Changed
- **Context Management:** The system prompt (`create_system_prompt`) now loads concise conversation summaries instead of full conversation histories, optimizing token usage and improving performance.
- **Application Startup Flow:** Refactored `ask.py` to configure the API client once at startup and pass it to all necessary components. The startup sequence now completes all pending summarization tasks before launching the main UI.
- **Conversation Saving:** The `save_conversation_md` method in `ui.py` now triggers the `SummaryWorker` to create a summary file after successfully saving the full conversation markdown.

### Fixed
- **Conversation Counter:** Corrected an issue where the conversation counter could be miscalculated. It now accurately determines the next conversation number by checking for both `conversation_N.md` and `conversation_N_summary.md` files.
- **Path Exclusion:** Improved the logic for excluding the conversation directory from codebase analysis, making it more robust, especially when custom conversation paths are used.

```

I will now apply these changes to the respective files.
