The user requested to add a token counter to their application using the Google Gemini API. They provided documentation showing methods like `count_tokens` (for input before sending) and `usage_metadata` (for input, output, and total after receiving a response).

The AI suggested implementing this by:
1.  Displaying the `prompt_token_count`, `candidates_token_count`, and `total_token_count` from the response's `usage_metadata` directly in the chat UI after each model response (`ui.py` modification).
2.  Optionally, printing the input token count using `model.count_tokens` before sending the message for debugging purposes (`worker.py` modification).

Code diffs were provided for both suggested modifications.
