Here's a concise summary of the conversation:

*   **User's Main Question 1:** How to make the codebase analysis tool (InsightCoder) analyze external projects given a directory path, instead of just its own code?
*   **AI's Answer 1:** Implement a `--project-path` command-line argument using Python's `argparse` module. Modify the code collection and Git diff functions (`get_codebase`, `get_git_diff`) to accept and use this path. Update documentation.
*   **User's Main Question 2:** The UI window title and the AI's system prompt are still specific to "InsightCoder" when analyzing other projects, which is confusing. How to fix this?
*   **AI's Answer 2:** Make the UI window title dynamic to show the name of the analyzed project's directory. Make the AI's system prompt more generic, instructing it to act as a general "codebase analyzer" rather than the "InsightCoder project" itself. Also suggested a cleaner way to pass the project path to the UI.
