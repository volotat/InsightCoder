**User:**

Let's expand "Example Prompts" section in `README.md` with more diverse and practical examples. Clarify in documentation**: Add detailed explanation of conversation history, context window, and token usage in `README.md` to improve user understanding. I would generaly to make readme a bit more consise and remove some repeating un unimportant points from it. Please, provide necessery change and the final version of the Readme.md file.

# InsightCoder

**InsightCoder** is a tool engineered to provide AI-powered insights directly into your codebase. Utilizing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), InsightCoder empowers you to ask natural language questions about your software projects and receive intelligent, context-aware answers directly in your terminal.

Initially developed as an AI-powered assistant to aid in the development of the [Anagnorisis project](https://github.com/volotat/Anagnorisis) (a local recommendation system), InsightCoder has grown into a versatile standalone tool for any software development endeavor.

**⚠️ Important Notice**: InsightCoder operates by sending your project's source code to an LLM service (like Google Gemini) for in-depth analysis. **To protect your privacy, rigorously ensure that your project folders and files DO NOT contain any personal, confidential, or sensitive information when using InsightCoder.**

| **Tool Category**   | AI-Powered Codebase Analysis Tool             | AI Pair Programmer / Code Assistant             |

**InsightCoder excels at providing a holistic understanding of your project**, enabling you to ask broad questions and receive context-aware answers based on the entire codebase.  It's designed for scenarios where you need to grasp the overall architecture, understand complex logic spanning multiple files, or onboard to a new project quickly.

**GitHub Copilot, on the other hand, shines in real-time code completion and suggestion within your editor.** It's incredibly efficient for speeding up code writing and generating repetitive code blocks.

**Think of them as complementary tools:**

*   **Use GitHub Copilot** for accelerating your daily coding tasks, writing code more efficiently line-by-line.
*   **Use InsightCoder** when you need to step back and understand the project as a whole, ask high-level questions, or explore unfamiliar codebases.

## Getting Started

**System Requirements:**

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   pip package installer

**Installation Guide:**

1.  **Clone the InsightCoder GitHub Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder
    cd InsightCoder
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Best Practice):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .env
    # Activate your virtual environment:
    # For Linux/macOS:
    source .env/bin/activate
    # For Windows:
    .env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Python Libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Your LLM API Key:**

    InsightCoder is currently configured to use the Google Gemini API.  Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and set it as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    ```

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Open your Terminal and Navigate to the InsightCoder directory:**

    ```bash
    cd InsightCoder
    ```

2.  **Execute the `ask.py` script to begin an interactive session:**

    ```bash
    python ask.py
    ```

3.  **Start Interacting with your Codebase using Natural Language Questions!**

    Type your questions directly into the command line prompt. InsightCoder will process your query, analyze your project's code, and present the AI-generated response directly in your terminal window.

## Future Directions

The vision for InsightCoder extends beyond a simple question-answering tool. Future development may explore:

*   **Evolving into an AI Code Agent:** Investigating the potential to transform InsightCoder into a more proactive AI agent capable of assisting in code development, suggesting improvements, and even generating code snippets with minimal oversight.
*   **Expanding LLM Support:**  Adding support for other popular Large Language Models beyond Google Gemini, offering users greater flexibility and choice.
*   **Enhanced Code Modification Capabilities:**  Potentially integrating features to allow InsightCoder to suggest and even automatically apply code refactoring or improvements based on its analysis.

## Beyond Code: Analyzing Any Git Repository

While named "InsightCoder," this tool is not limited to just programming code. **InsightCoder can effectively analyze any project that is managed within a Git repository.** This includes:

*   **Documentation Projects:** Understand the structure and content of large documentation sets.
*   **Book Manuscripts:** Analyze chapters, characters, or plotlines within a book project.
*   **Blog Content:** Get insights into the themes, topics, or organization of a blog repository.
*   **Configuration Repositories:** Analyze complex configuration setups.

**As long as your project is in Git, InsightCoder can provide AI-powered insights by analyzing its content and structure.** Simply point InsightCoder to the root directory of your Git repository using the `--project-path` argument, and start asking questions!
