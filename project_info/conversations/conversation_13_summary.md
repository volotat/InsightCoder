This conversation addresses two issues with a token counter:
1.  **Inaccuracy:** It only counted the current input text, not the full context (system prompt + history + current input).
2.  **Performance:** Frequent updates slowed down text input.

The AI provided code modifications to `ask_src/ui.py` to fix these:
*   **Accuracy:** The token counting logic was updated to include the system instruction, chat history, and the current input text.
*   **Performance:** Debouncing was implemented using a `QTimer` so the token count only updates after a pause in typing, significantly improving responsiveness.
