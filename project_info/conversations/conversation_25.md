Let's wrap up current changes and reflect them in the v0.1.3 changlog.



**Model:**

Okay, let's create the changelog entry for `v0.1.3` to document the latest changes related to conversation folder control and the initial steps toward automated diff application.

Here's a proposed changelog entry for `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## [v0.1.3] - 2025-02-16 *(Replace with the actual release date)*

### Added
- **Command-line option `--conversation-path` (or `-c`)** to `ask.py` for specifying a custom directory for conversation history, providing users with control over conversation storage location.
- **`.gitignore` handling for conversation folder:** Implemented logic to ensure conversation loading works correctly even when the conversation folder (default or custom) is ignored by Git, preserving conversation history while respecting `.gitignore` for codebase analysis.
- **Diff Detection in AI Responses:** Implemented logic in `diff_detector.py` to automatically detect code diff blocks within the AI's responses, identifying potential code modifications suggested by the AI.
- **File Path Extraction from Diff Blocks:** Enhanced diff detection to extract file paths from the headers of detected diff blocks, enabling identification of target files for code changes.
- **File Path Validation:** Implemented validation logic to check if extracted file paths from diff blocks correspond to existing files within the analyzed project, preventing application of diffs to invalid or non-existent files.
- **Unit Tests for Diff Detection:** Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_diff_detector.py` for the `detect_diff_blocks` function, ensuring the robustness and correctness of diff detection and file path extraction logic.
- **Test for Conversation Folder Handling:** Added integration tests in `tests/test_conversation_folder.py` to verify correct conversation folder handling, including `.gitignore` scenarios and custom conversation paths.

### Changed
- Refactored `detect_diff_blocks` function in `diff_detector.py` to return a list of dictionaries, each containing diff block content and extracted file path, improving the structure of diff block information.
- Updated `ChatWorker` in `worker.py` to utilize the new `detect_diff_blocks` function for processing AI responses and logging detected diff blocks with file path information to the console.
- Modified `ask.py` and `ui.py` to accept and pass the `conversation_path` command-line argument, enabling users to specify custom conversation folders.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the implemented features and highlight next priorities, providing an up-to-date project development plan.

### Fixed
- (No explicit bug fixes in this release, but focused on feature enhancements and robustness).

### Deprecated
- (None in this release)

### Removed
- (None in this release)

### Security
- (No specific security changes in this release)
```
