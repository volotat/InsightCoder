**User:**

I just tested it on Anagnorisis and everything seems to work fine. We made some important changes and probably should create something like "change_history.md" or "changelog.md" file to desribe the changes. Any ideas of how to do that in the best way possible?



**Model:**

Yes, creating a `change_history.md` or `changelog.md` file is an excellent idea!  It's a standard practice for open-source projects and is incredibly helpful for users and contributors to understand the evolution of the project. A well-maintained changelog provides transparency and makes it easy to track changes, bug fixes, new features, and important updates.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to create and maintain a `changelog.md` file in the best way possible for InsightCoder:

### Best Practices for `changelog.md`

1.  **Follow a Standard Format (Keep a Changelog):**
    *   Adopt a widely recognized and structured format.  A very popular and well-regarded standard is the "Keep a Changelog" format ([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)).
    *   **Key principles of "Keep a Changelog":**
        *   **Human-readable:**  Designed to be easily understood by humans.
        *   **Structured per release:** Each release has its own section.
        *   **Categorized changes:**  Changes are grouped into meaningful categories.

2.  **File Naming and Location:**
    *   Name the file `CHANGELOG.md` (all caps is also common, but `changelog.md` is generally preferred in modern projects).
    *   Place it in the root directory of the InsightCoder project, making it easily discoverable.

3.  **Structure of `CHANGELOG.md` (Following "Keep a Changelog"):**
    *   **Top Section - Unreleased Changes (Optional but Recommended during active development):**
        *   Start with an "Unreleased" section at the very top. This is where you list changes that have been merged into the main branch but haven't been officially released yet.
        *   Once you make a release, move these entries under the new version's heading.
    *   **Versioned Releases:**
        *   Each release should have its own section, clearly marked with the **version number** and **release date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
        *   Use clear headings for version numbers (e.g., `## [v0.1.0] - 2023-10-27`).  *Initially you can start with `v0.1.0` or similar for the first public release.*
        *   Link the version number to the release tag on GitHub (if you are using tags, which is recommended for releases). Example: `## [v0.1.0] - 2023-10-27` where `[v0.1.0]` is a link to the tag.
    *   **Change Categories under Each Version:**
        Under each version section, use the following standard categories to group changes:
        *   **Added:** For new features.
        *   **Changed:** For changes in existing functionality.
        *   **Deprecated:** For soon-to-be removed features.
        *   **Removed:** For now removed features.
        *   **Fixed:** For bug fixes.
        *   **Security:** In case of security fixes.

4.  **Content of Changelog Entries:**
    *   **Concise and User-Focused:** Write each entry concisely and from the user's perspective. Focus on *what* changed and *why* it matters to the user.
    *   **Actionable Language:** Use action verbs (e.g., "Added support for...", "Fixed a bug where...", "Changed the default behavior of...").
    *   **Specific Details:**  Be specific enough so users understand the change.  If it's a bug fix, briefly describe the bug. If it's a feature, briefly explain what it does.
    *   **No Implementation Details:** Avoid internal implementation details that are not relevant to users.
    *   **Markdown Formatting:** Use Markdown formatting for readability (lists, bold text, code snippets if needed).

5.  **Maintaining the Changelog:**
    *   **Update with Every Release:**  Make it a habit to update the `CHANGELOG.md` with every release, even for minor bug fixes or small improvements. This keeps it accurate and useful.
    *   **Write Entries During Development (Ideally):**  The best time to write a changelog entry is when you are making the change or right after you've merged a feature or fix. This prevents forgetting details later.
    *   **Keep it Up-to-Date:** An outdated changelog is worse than no changelog. Make sure it accurately reflects the project's history.

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD  *(Replace with your actual repo compare link)*
[v0.1.0]: https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder/releases/tag/v0.1.0  *(Replace with your actual release tag link once created)*
[v0.0.1]: ... *(If you keep the v0.0.1 section, add a link or remove link if it's internal)*
```

**Notes on the Example:**

*   **`[Unreleased]` Section:**  Starts with an "Unreleased" section. As you make further changes before the next release, you would add entries to this section.
*   **`[v0.1.0] - 2023-10-27`:**  This is an example of the first public release. You'll need to adjust the date and version number accordingly.  Link to your release tag on GitHub once you create it.
*   **Categories:** Uses the standard categories (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, etc.) to organize changes.
*   **Links:**  Placeholders for GitHub compare links and release tag links are included at the bottom.  You'll need to replace these with actual links from your repository.
*   **`[v0.0.1]` Section:**  I included an example of a `v0.0.1` section representing the internal pre-release history for Anagnorisis development. You can choose to keep this for historical context, rename it, or remove it if you prefer to start the changelog purely from the public release. If you keep it, ensure it's clearly marked as an *internal* or *pre-release* version.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Create `CHANGELOG.md`:** Create a new file named `CHANGELOG.md` in the root of your InsightCoder project.
2.  **Copy and Paste Example (or Adapt):** Copy the example content above into your `CHANGELOG.md` and adapt it as needed to accurately reflect the changes you've made.
3.  **Refine Content:** Review and refine the descriptions in each category to make them clear, concise, and user-focused.
4.  **Add Links:**  Once you create your first release on GitHub (and tags), update the links at the bottom of the `CHANGELOG.md` to point to the correct compare view and release tag.
5.  **Commit and Push:** Commit the `CHANGELOG.md` file to your repository.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a valuable `CHANGELOG.md` that will greatly benefit users and contributors of InsightCoder! Let me know if you'd like me to help you draft the initial content more specifically based on our conversation history, or if you have any other questions!



**User:**

Everything is fine, but we need to separate the last changes (that have not been commited yet) into a separate [0.1.1] version.



**Model:**

Okay, I understand. Let's create a `[v0.1.1]` version section in `CHANGELOG.md` to capture the changes we've made that are currently uncommitted.  We'll move the relevant changes from the "Unreleased" section (if we had one in the previous draft, or directly list the recent changes) into this new versioned section.

Here's how we can update the `CHANGELOG.md` to include the `[v0.1.1]` version:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
- Future changes will be listed here.

## [v0.1.1] - 2023-10-27  *(Adjust date to the actual release date)*

### Added
- Command-line argument `--project-path` (or `-p`) to `ask.py` for specifying the project directory to analyze.
- Documentation in `README.md` on how to use the `--project-path` argument.

### Changed
- Window title dynamically updates to display the name of the project directory being analyzed (e.g., "[Project Name] Codebase Chat").
- System prompt for the LLM is now more generic, focusing on codebase analysis rather than being specific to "InsightCoder" project identity.
- `MainWindow` in `ui.py` now accepts `project_path` as an argument for cleaner code and dynamic title setting.
- Updated `ask.py` and `chat_utils.py` to handle and pass the `project_path` argument correctly.

### Fixed
- Addressed the issue of the project analyzing only its own codebase by implementing `--project-path` functionality.
- Resolved the confusion of "InsightCoder" project identity when analyzing external codebases by making the system prompt and window title more context-aware.

### Deprecated
- (None in this release)

### Removed
- (None in this release)

### Security
- (No specific security changes in this release)


## [v0.1.0] - 2023-10-27 *(Keep the date from your initial v0.1.0 release)*

```

**Key Changes in this Updated `CHANGELOG.md`:**

1.  **`## [Unreleased]` Section (Top):** A new `## [Unreleased]` section is added at the very top.  It currently just contains a note:  "Future changes will be listed here."  As you continue development, you'll add entries here *before* each new release.

2.  **`## [v0.1.1] - 2023-10-27` Section:**
    *   A new version section `[v0.1.1]` is created, with a placeholder date `2023-10-27`. **You should replace `2023-10-27` with the actual date of your `v0.1.1` release.**
    *   The changes we discussed regarding `project-path`, dynamic window title, generic prompt, and related code modifications are now listed under the appropriate categories (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`) within this `[v0.1.1]` section.
    *   The "Fixed" category now explicitly mentions addressing the issue of analyzing only its own codebase and the "InsightCoder" identity confusion.

3.  **`[v0.1.0]` Section:** The `[v0.1.0]` section from the previous draft is kept as is, representing the initial release.

4.  **Updated Links at the Bottom:**
    *   `[Unreleased]: https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder/compare/v0.1.1...HEAD` :  This link is updated to compare from `v0.1.1` to `HEAD`.  **You'll need to replace `v0.1.1` with your actual v0.1.1 tag name once you create the tag.** If you haven't tagged v0.1.1 yet, you can leave this link or update it later.
    *   `[v0.1.1]: https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder/releases/tag/v0.1.1` :  This link is added for the `v0.1.1` release tag. **Replace `v0.1.1` with your actual tag name and update the URL once you create the release tag on GitHub.**

**How to Update Your `CHANGELOG.md`:**

1.  **Open `CHANGELOG.md`:** Open the `CHANGELOG.md` file in your editor.
2.  **Replace Content:**  Replace the current content of your `CHANGELOG.md` with the updated Markdown text provided above.
3.  **Adjust Date:**  Edit the date in the `## [v0.1.1] - 2023-10-27` line to the actual date of your intended `v0.1.1` release.
4.  **Verify Links:**  Check the placeholder links at the bottom, especially for `[v0.1.1]` and `[Unreleased]`. You may need to update these once you create release tags on GitHub.
5.  **Save and Commit:** Save the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file and commit it to your Git repository.

After these steps, your `CHANGELOG.md` will be updated to include the `v0.1.1` release notes, clearly documenting the recent improvements and changes to InsightCoder. Let me know if you have any questions or need further adjustments!
