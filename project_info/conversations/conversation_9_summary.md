Here's a summary of the conversation:

The user asked to enhance the project's `README.md` by adding a comparison with GitHub Copilot and clarifying that the tool can analyze any Git repository, not just code. The AI provided a comparison table highlighting InsightCoder's project-wide context and broader scope, and added sections to the README explaining these points. The user then requested adding License, Contributing, and Support sections. The AI recommended the MIT License and suggested content for these sections. Following user feedback that the initial Contributing and Support sections were too verbose and the Support section redundant, the AI agreed to simplify, ultimately suggesting removing the separate Support section and keeping a concise Contributing section focused on bug reports via GitHub issues.
