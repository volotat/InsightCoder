The user requested updates to `test_diff_detector.py` to reflect changes in the `detect_diff_blocks` method.

The AI provided the updated test file, which includes:
*   Modifications to existing tests to access diff content via `['diff_block_content']`, indicating the method now returns a structured object/dictionary.
*   Addition of new test cases (`test_extract_file_path_...`) specifically to verify the extraction and inclusion of the file path (`['file_path']`) in the method's output.
