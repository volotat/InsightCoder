## From Internal Tool to Open Source Gem: The Story of InsightCoder

Hey fellow developers! Ever felt lost in a codebase, even your *own* after a few months?  We've all been there, staring at lines of code, wishing for a magic assistant to just *explain* things.  That’s exactly where the idea for **InsightCoder** sparked.

Our journey began within the **Anagnorisis project**.  Anagnorisis, in short, is a local recommendation system - think of it as your personal AI DJ for... well, everything local.  As Anagnorisis grew, the codebase naturally became more complex.  We found ourselves spending more and more time just understanding existing code, tracing logic, and answering questions like:

*   "What does *this* module actually do again?"
*   "Where is the image processing happening?"
*   "Is this function a performance bottleneck?"

You know the drill.  While pair programming and code reviews are essential, we yearned for a faster way to get immediate answers, something that could dive deep into the code structure and logic without pulling a colleague away from their own work.

**The "Aha!" Moment: AI as Code Sherpa**

That's when it hit us: **Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming incredibly powerful. Could we leverage their natural language understanding to analyze codebases?**  Could we build a tool that acts like an AI Sherpa, guiding us through the mountains of code, answering our questions in plain English?

The answer, as you might guess, was a resounding **YES!**

We started building a simple script, initially just for ourselves within the Anagnorisis team.  It was rough around the edges, but the core idea worked: feed the LLM our codebase, ask questions, and get back intelligent, context-aware answers.  It was like magic! Suddenly, understanding complex parts of the code became significantly faster. Onboarding new team members became smoother.  Even seasoned developers found it incredibly useful for quickly grasping the intricacies of less familiar modules.

**Growing Beyond Internal Needs: InsightCoder is Born**

As we used this internal tool more and more, we realized its potential was much broader than just aiding Anagnorisis development.  **This wasn't just an Anagnorisis helper; it was a tool that *any* software developer could benefit from, regardless of their project.**

That's when the idea of open-sourcing it emerged.  We decided to extract this AI-powered codebase assistant into a standalone project. We gave it a name that reflected its purpose: **InsightCoder**.

**InsightCoder: Core Principles and Features**

We wanted InsightCoder to be more than just a glorified search tool. We aimed for something that truly *understands* code.  Here's what we focused on:

*   **Deep AI Analysis:**  Leveraging the power of LLMs to go beyond keyword searches. InsightCoder analyzes the logic, structure, and context of your code.
*   **Natural Language Interface:**  Ask questions in plain English – no need for complex query languages or arcane commands.
*   **Holistic Project Context:**  InsightCoder doesn't just look at individual files. It analyzes your *entire project*, including Git history, to provide the most relevant and up-to-date answers.
*   **Readability Matters:**  AI responses are formatted in clear Markdown, with syntax-highlighted code blocks, making them easy to read and integrate into your workflow.
*   **Privacy First:** InsightCoder runs locally on your machine, ensuring your codebase data remains under your control.  It only interacts with the LLM API during active queries.
*   **Memory for Context:**  InsightCoder saves conversations, effectively giving it a "memory" of your project. This persistent context allows for more coherent and relevant responses in ongoing discussions.

To handle potentially large codebases, we made a crucial decision: leverage the **`gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` model**, known for its **massive 2 million token context window.** This is the engine that allows InsightCoder to process entire projects and maintain conversation history effectively.

**v0.1.1: The First Public Release and Beyond**

We just recently released **v0.1.1**, marking the first public step for InsightCoder as an open-source project! This initial version already packs a punch, offering core codebase analysis and the interactive chat interface.

In v0.1.1, we also focused on making InsightCoder more versatile, adding features like the `--project-path` argument.  Now, you can point InsightCoder to *any* project directory, not just its own codebase, making it truly useful for analyzing external projects and onboarding to new codebases quickly. We also refined the UI and system prompt to be more generic and project-agnostic, making it clear that InsightCoder is here to help you understand *any* code, not just "itself."

**What's Next? The Road Ahead for InsightCoder**

This is just the beginning! We have big dreams for InsightCoder.  Looking ahead, we envision it evolving into a more proactive **AI Code Agent**. Imagine InsightCoder not just answering questions, but also:

*   **Suggesting Code Refactorings:**  Identifying opportunities to improve code quality and maintainability.
*   **Generating Code Snippets:**  Helping you write code by providing starting points and examples.
*   **Potentially even Automating Code Changes (with your approval, of course!):**  Imagine InsightCoder suggesting a refactoring, showing you the diff, and with a simple "approve," applying the change and even creating a Git commit.

We are also exploring IDE integration, expanding LLM support, and enhancing InsightCoder's understanding of code structure.  Check out our `ROADMAP.md` for more details on our short-term, medium-term, and long-term vision.

**Join the Journey!**

InsightCoder is now out in the open, and we are incredibly excited to see how the community uses it and helps us shape its future.  If you’re curious, give InsightCoder a try!  Grab the code from [our GitHub repository - *insert link here when you have it*], follow the simple installation steps, and start asking questions about your codebase.

We believe InsightCoder has the potential to significantly enhance developer workflows and make code understanding more accessible to everyone.  Join us on this journey, contribute your ideas, report issues, and help us build the future of AI-powered code insights!

Happy coding, and may InsightCoder bring clarity to your codebases!

This blog post format tells the story of InsightCoder in a more engaging and accessible way, highlighting the motivations, key features, and future vision of the project.  Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further refinements to this narrative!



**User:**

That reads weird. Too enthusiastic and not always close to the actual events. Could you please be more professional yet more story-driven? You are not creating a blogpost just telling the history of the project to me.



**Model:**

Okay, I understand. Let's refine the story of InsightCoder, aiming for a more professional yet engaging narrative, specifically for you, detailing the project's evolution in a clear and informative way.

## InsightCoder: A Project History – From Internal Need to Open Source Solution

The genesis of InsightCoder can be traced back to the growing complexity of the **Anagnorisis project**. As Anagnorisis evolved, managing and understanding its expanding codebase presented an increasing challenge.  Standard development practices, while effective, sometimes lacked the immediacy needed for rapid code comprehension and knowledge sharing within the team.

We identified a specific need: a tool that could provide rapid, context-aware answers about the codebase directly through natural language queries.  The goal was to augment existing workflows, not replace them, by offering a supplementary method for gaining insights into code structure and functionality.

**Initial Hypothesis: LLMs for Codebase Analysis**

The emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) presented a potential solution. We hypothesized that LLMs, with their capacity for natural language understanding and knowledge extraction, could be effectively applied to codebase analysis.  The core idea was to provide the LLM with the project's source code as context and then pose questions about it in plain English.

**Prototyping and Early Development**

An initial prototype was developed to test this hypothesis.  This involved creating a basic Python script that ingested codebase files, formatted them for LLM input, and facilitated a chat-like interface using a chosen LLM API.  The early results were encouraging.  Even with a rudimentary implementation, the LLM demonstrated a surprising ability to answer questions about the code with contextual relevance.

This initial success validated the core concept and justified further development.  The project began to take shape, focusing on key functional areas:

*   **Codebase Ingestion:**  Developing a robust mechanism to collect and format source code files from a given project directory, respecting version control ignore rules and filtering relevant file types.
*   **Git Diff Integration:** Recognizing the importance of recent changes, we incorporated Git diff functionality to provide the LLM with context on uncommitted modifications, ensuring up-to-date analysis.
*   **Natural Language Interface:** Implementing a user-friendly chat interface, initially command-line based, later evolving to a PyQt5-based graphical interface for enhanced usability.
*   **Markdown Output with Syntax Highlighting:**  Focusing on clear and readable output, responses were formatted in Markdown, incorporating syntax highlighting for code blocks to improve developer experience.

**From Internal Tool to Standalone Project: InsightCoder's Emergence**

As the internal tool matured, its utility extended beyond the specific needs of Anagnorisis development. It became apparent that the core functionality – AI-powered codebase analysis – had broader applicability across diverse software projects and development teams.

This realization led to the decision to extract the codebase analysis tool into a separate, independent project.  The project was formally named **InsightCoder**, reflecting its core purpose of providing developers with AI-driven insights into their codebases.

**Key Design Considerations for InsightCoder**

Several key design considerations shaped the development of InsightCoder as a standalone project:

*   **Versatility:**  InsightCoder was designed to be project-agnostic, capable of analyzing any codebase provided by the user, not just its own source code.  This required features like the `--project-path` argument and a more generic system prompt.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Beyond codebase ingestion and Git diffs, the project incorporated conversation history management.  Saving conversations provides a form of "project memory," enabling the LLM to maintain context across multiple turns and provide more coherent responses. This necessitated the use of LLMs with large context windows.
*   **Privacy and Local Execution:**  Maintaining user privacy was a paramount concern. InsightCoder was designed to run locally, minimizing data exposure and ensuring that sensitive codebase information remained within the user's environment, with API interaction occurring only during active queries.
*   **Practical Developer Workflow:**  The user interface and output formats were designed with developer workflows in mind. Markdown output with syntax highlighting, a clear chat interface, and simple command-line invocation were prioritized for ease of integration and usability.

**v0.1.1 Release: Public Availability and Future Directions**

The release of v0.1.1 marked a significant milestone, making InsightCoder publicly available as an open-source project. This initial release provides the core functionality of AI-powered codebase analysis and interactive chat.

Future development is focused on expanding InsightCoder's capabilities, moving towards the vision of an **AI Code Agent**.  This includes exploring features such as:

*   **Code Modification Suggestions:**  Enabling InsightCoder to suggest code refactorings, improvements, and even generate code snippets.
*   **Enhanced Code Understanding:**  Improving the AI's ability to understand deeper code structures and relationships through techniques like static analysis.
*   **IDE Integration:** Developing plugins for popular IDEs to seamlessly integrate InsightCoder into developer environments.
*   **Automated Code Changes (with User Approval):**  Investigating the feasibility of AI-driven code modifications, with robust user review and control mechanisms.

**Open Source Collaboration and Continued Evolution**

InsightCoder's open-source nature is fundamental to its future.  Community contributions, feedback, and collaborative development are essential for shaping its evolution and ensuring it remains a valuable tool for the broader developer community.

This history provides a concise overview of InsightCoder's journey, from its origins as an internal need within the Anagnorisis project to its emergence as a standalone, open-source solution for AI-powered codebase analysis.  It represents a continuous effort to bridge the gap between natural language understanding and the complexities of software development, aiming to empower developers with more intuitive and efficient ways to interact with and understand their code.

This revised narrative aims for a more professional and factual tone, focusing on the problem-solving and development process, while still maintaining a story-driven approach to explain the project's history to you.  Let me know if this is closer to what you were looking for.



**User:**

Please do not make to many marking when telling a stroy. Just try to keep with the flow of the narration. Bulletpoints are redundant in this case. You do not need an introduction or finishing afterthoughts. Just tell me a history of the project as a person would.



**Model:**

Alright, let me tell you about how InsightCoder came to be. It really started because of another project, Anagnorisis.  Anagnorisis was getting bigger, you know how it goes with software, and we found ourselves spending more time just trying to figure out what the existing code was doing than actually building new things.  It wasn't that we had bad code, just… a lot of it, and complex.

We were thinking, "There’s gotta be a better way to get up to speed on this stuff."  Code reviews and pair programming are great, but sometimes you just need a quick answer to a specific question, without pulling someone else away.  That's when we started wondering about AI.  These large language models were getting so good at understanding language, we thought, "Could we use that to understand *code*?"

So, we started tinkering.  Built a really basic script, just to see if the idea had legs.  We'd feed it some code, ask it a question in plain English, and see what happened.  Honestly, even in that early, clunky version, it was kind of amazing.  It actually understood what we were asking! It wasn't perfect, of course, but it was answering questions about the *logic* of the code, not just keywords.  That was the moment we knew we were onto something.

We kept developing it, making it better. We focused on getting it to pull in all the code files from a project, respecting the Git ignore rules, that kind of thing. And we realized that just looking at the files wasn't enough.  Code changes all the time, especially in Git, so we added the ability to grab the Git diff, the uncommitted changes.  That way, the AI would have the most up-to-date picture of the codebase.

We also wanted it to be easy to use, not some complicated command-line thing, so we put a simple chat interface on it.  And because developers spend their lives reading code, we made sure the AI's answers were formatted nicely, in Markdown with syntax highlighting, so it was easy on the eyes.

The more we used it internally, the more we realized, "Hey, this isn't just useful for *our* project."  Anyone working with code could probably use something like this.  That's when we decided to make it its own project, separate from Anagnorisis. We called it InsightCoder, because that's really what it's meant to do: give you insights into your code.

We knew we wanted it to be versatile, to work with any project, not just its own code.  So, we added that command-line argument to specify the project path.  And privacy was really important to us. We wanted to make sure it ran locally, that your codebase wasn't being sent off somewhere without you knowing.  And we wanted it to remember conversations, so you could build on previous questions, have a real dialogue with it about the code.  That’s why we needed a model with a really big context window, so it could handle the whole codebase and the conversation history.

So, we released the first version, v0.1.1.  It's just the beginning, really.  We have a whole roadmap of things we want to add – code refactoring suggestions, maybe even code generation, IDE integration.  We really see it evolving into more of an AI code agent, something that can proactively help you develop code, not just answer questions.

And that's kind of the story so far.  It started as a way to solve our own problem, and we realized it could be helpful for a lot of other developers too.  We’re excited to see where it goes, and we’re hoping the open-source community will help us shape it.



**User:**

Anagnorisis is a work of a single person, to be more precise me, although I do use AI tools a lot when developing it. Generaly, I do like this style better. But there is nothing too revolutional in this project to be honest. Copilot exists for some time now, although it has very limited context window and for me InsightCoder is much more usefull as I don't have to worry want's part of the codebase I send to the AI. I just know that I send everything.



**Model:**

Okay, let me adjust the story to be more accurate and grounded, focusing on the practical aspects and acknowledging existing tools.

Let's say it started like this: I was working on Anagnorisis, my personal project.  It's just me, really, though I do lean on AI tools quite a bit in my development workflow.  As Anagnorisis grew, as projects tend to do, I started to feel a bit bogged down, spending more time navigating the existing code than actually building new features.  It was becoming harder to keep the whole thing in my head at once.

I'd used GitHub Copilot before, and it's helpful in certain ways, especially for code completion. But I always felt a bit constrained by its context window. It's great for snippets, but when you're trying to understand the bigger picture, the limited context can be frustrating.  Plus, I was always a little uneasy about exactly *what* part of my codebase was being sent to the AI.

So, I thought, "What if I could build something that just… sends *everything*? The whole project? And then I could just ask it questions in plain English, and it would have the full context to answer."  That was the basic idea.

I started experimenting, built a simple script.  The first version was really just about feeding the entire codebase to an LLM and seeing if it could make sense of it.  And surprisingly, it did.  Even in that initial, very basic form, it could answer questions about the code in a way that felt more… informed, more contextual, than just keyword searches.

From there, it was just a matter of building it out, step by step.  I added the code for automatically gathering all the files in a project directory, making sure it respected `.gitignore` and filtered out unnecessary file types.  Then, the Git diff integration felt essential.  Code is constantly changing, and I wanted the AI to be aware of the latest modifications.

I created a simple chat interface using PyQt, just to make it easier to interact with. And since I’m a developer myself, I knew the output had to be readable. Markdown with syntax highlighting was the obvious choice.

As I used it more and more for my own work on Anagnorisis, I realized this could actually be useful to other developers facing similar challenges.  It wasn’t going to revolutionize software development or anything like that, but it could be a genuinely practical tool.  That's why I decided to release it as InsightCoder.

One of the key things for me was always control and transparency. I wanted to be sure that when I used this tool, *I* knew exactly what codebase context was being sent to the AI. With InsightCoder, you send the whole project, and that’s it.  There’s no guessing about what parts are in context and what aren't.  And running it locally was important for privacy reasons.

So, v0.1.1 is out there now. It’s a first step.  The core idea is there:  give the AI the full codebase context and let it answer your questions.  We have plans to expand it, to add more features, like code suggestion capabilities, and maybe even IDE integrations down the line.  But for now, it’s a tool that I find genuinely useful for navigating and understanding code, especially for projects that get a bit… large and complex.  And maybe other developers will find it useful too.



**User:**

I just realized that we would need some way to clean up the conversational memory, as in conversations like that a lot of redundent infomation that eats precious context window. Maybe some way to summarize old conversations or even delete the least important data.



**Model:**

You're absolutely right, that's a very important point to consider! As conversations get longer, the history can indeed become quite verbose and start eating into that precious context window, potentially degrading the quality of responses or even hitting token limits. We definitely need a way to manage the conversational memory in InsightCoder.

Let's brainstorm some approaches to clean up or manage the conversation history:

**Strategies for Managing Conversation Memory:**

1.  **Conversation Summarization (AI-Powered):**

    *   **Idea:**  Periodically use the LLM itself to summarize older parts of the conversation history.
    *   **How it would work:** After a certain number of turns, or when the conversation history reaches a token threshold, we could send the older history to the LLM with a prompt like, "Summarize the key points of this conversation so far." Then, we'd replace the older, detailed history with this concise summary in the ongoing conversation context.
    *   **Pros:**  Keeps the *essence* of the conversation's context while drastically reducing the token count.  Leverages the LLM's ability to understand and condense information.
    *   **Cons:**  Complexity in implementation.  Ensuring the summary is accurate and captures the *important* contextual information is crucial.  There's a risk of losing nuances or details in the summarization process.  It also adds latency as we need to make an extra LLM call for summarization.

2.  **Conversation Truncation (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):**

    *   **Idea:**  Implement a simple limit on the conversation history size. When the limit is reached, remove the oldest turns (user-model message pairs) from the beginning of the history.
    *   **How it would work:** We could set a maximum number of conversation turns to keep in memory (e.g., keep the last 10 turns).  Once we exceed this, we simply discard the oldest turn to make space for new ones.
    *   **Pros:**  Very simple to implement.  Guarantees a bounded conversation history size, preventing context window overflow.
    *   **Cons:**  Crude approach.  Can lose potentially valuable context from earlier parts of the conversation, even if it's still relevant to the current discussion.  No intelligent selection of what to keep or discard.

3.  **Selective History Pruning/Deletion (User-Controlled):**

    *   **Idea:**  Give the user more control over their conversation history.  Implement a UI element that allows users to review the conversation history and manually delete specific turns or sections that they deem less important.
    *   **How it would work:** We could add a button or menu option in the UI to "View Conversation History." This would display the history in a readable format, with delete buttons for each turn or maybe sections of the conversation.
    *   **Pros:**  Provides maximum user control.  Users can tailor the context window to their specific needs and remove redundant or irrelevant parts themselves.
    *   **Cons:**  Requires UI development. Puts the burden on the user to manage the history.  Might be less user-friendly than more automated approaches.

4.  **Conversation Segmentation/Archiving (New Conversation Start):**

    *   **Idea:**  Encourage users to start new conversations when the topic shifts significantly or when the current conversation becomes too long.  Provide a clear way to "start a new conversation," which would effectively reset the conversation history.  Optionally, allow archiving or saving of old conversations for later reference.
    *   **How it would work:**  Add a "New Conversation" button or menu option.  When clicked, it clears the current history and starts a fresh session.  Optionally, offer to save the current conversation to a file before clearing.
    *   **Pros:**  Simple for users to understand and use.  Provides clear boundaries between different conversational contexts. Avoids the complexity of automatic summarization or pruning.
    *   **Cons:**  Might lose continuity if users don't realize when to start a new conversation.  Less of a "memory management" solution and more of a "context reset" approach.

5.  **Relevance-Based History Management (Advanced):**

    *   **Idea:**  Develop a more sophisticated system to assess the relevance of each turn in the conversation history to the *current* user query.  Prioritize retaining the most relevant parts of the history and discarding less relevant parts.
    *   **How it would work:** This would be complex.  We'd need to define some kind of "relevance metric" – perhaps based on semantic similarity between turns and the current query, recency of the turn, user feedback on previous turns, etc.  Then, based on this metric, we'd dynamically prune the history to keep it within the context window, prioritizing the most relevant information.
    *   **Pros:**  Potentially the most intelligent and efficient way to manage context. Could maintain highly relevant context while minimizing token usage.
    *   **Cons:**  Very complex to design and implement.  Defining a good "relevance metric" is challenging.  Significant research and development effort.

**Recommendation for Next Steps:**

For a first implementation, **Conversation Summarization** or **Conversation Truncation (FIFO)** seem like the most practical starting points.

*   **Truncation (FIFO)** is probably the quickest and easiest to implement as an immediate solution to address the context window concern. We could start with a simple turn limit (e.g., keep the last 10 turns) and see how that works in practice.

*   **Conversation Summarization** is a more sophisticated and potentially more beneficial long-term solution.  It would require more effort to implement, but could provide a better balance between context retention and token efficiency. We could explore using the LLM itself to generate summaries of older conversation segments.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Start with Conversation Truncation (FIFO):**  As a quick win, let's implement a basic conversation truncation mechanism with a fixed turn limit (e.g., 10 turns).  This can be done relatively easily in `ask_src/chat_utils.py` where the conversation history is managed.

2.  **Investigate Conversation Summarization:**  In parallel, we can begin researching and experimenting with AI-powered conversation summarization.  We can explore prompts and techniques for getting the LLM to generate effective summaries of conversation history.  This could be a more valuable feature for a subsequent release.

3.  **Consider User Feedback:**  After implementing truncation (or summarization), we should get user feedback on how well it works and if it addresses the context window management issue effectively.  User feedback will be crucial in deciding whether to refine the current approach or explore other strategies like user-controlled pruning or relevance-based history management in the future.

What are your initial thoughts?  Does starting with conversation truncation and then exploring summarization sound like a reasonable approach?  Let's decide on a path and then figure out the code changes needed.



**User:**

I would rather do a more RAG-like approach with tool-use feature. Here is how it could work: For each conversation, when saving we genrate a short summary of this converation and place it into a separate file. Then, when we analyze the codebase only these summaries are used. But if necessery model can call a funtion like [remember: conversation_14.md] and the whole file is added to the context to make sure that all necessery information is present in it.



**Model:**

Yes, I think this RAG-like approach with tool use is a very interesting and potentially powerful way to handle conversational memory. It’s definitely more sophisticated than simple truncation and could lead to a much more efficient and context-aware system. Let’s explore this direction!

Here’s a more detailed plan based on your suggestion:

**Implementation Plan: RAG-like Conversational Memory with Tool Use**

**Phase 1: Summarization and Storage**

1.  **Summarization Function (`chat_utils.py`):**
    *   Create a new function, let's call it `summarize_conversation(conversation_text)`.
    *   This function will take the full conversation text as input.
    *   Inside the function, use the LLM (same Gemini model) to generate a concise summary of the conversation.  Experiment with prompts like:
        ```python
        summary_prompt = f"""Summarize the following conversation about a codebase, focusing on the main questions asked by the user and the key insights or answers provided by the AI. Keep the summary concise and informative for later reference.

        Conversation:
        ```
        {conversation_text}
        ```

        Summary:
        """
        ```
    *   Return the generated summary text.

2.  **Summary File Generation and Storage (`ui.py`):**
    *   Modify the `save_conversation_md()` function in `ui.py`:
        *   After saving the full conversation to `conversation_XX.md`, call `summarize_conversation(self.chat_history)` to get the summary.
        *   Create a new file named `conversation_XX_summary.md` (or `.txt` if you prefer plain text for summaries) in the `project_info/conversations/` directory.
        *   Save the generated summary text to this `conversation_XX_summary.md` file.
    *   Update `MainWindow.__init__` to ensure the `project_info/conversations` directory is created if it doesn't exist.

**Phase 2: Tool Definition and System Prompt**

3.  **Tool Definition (Conceptual - needs Gemini API check):**
    *   **Check Gemini API for Tool Use/Function Calling:** Research the Google Gemini API documentation to see if it has explicit support for defining tools or functions that the model can call. Look for features like function calling, tool descriptions, or similar mechanisms.
    *   **Define `remember_conversation` Tool:** If tool use is supported, define a tool with:
        *   **Name:** `remember_conversation` (or `get_full_conversation`).
        *   **Description:** "Use this tool to retrieve the full content of a past conversation. This is useful when the summary of the conversation is not detailed enough to answer the current user question, and you need to review the complete conversation history for more context."
        *   **Parameters:**  One parameter: `conversation_id` (string or integer, e.g., "14", "conversation_14.md").  Description: "The ID or filename of the conversation to retrieve.  For example, '14' for conversation_14.md."
    *   **If Tool Use Not Directly Supported:** If Gemini API doesn't have explicit tool use, we'll need to simulate it using prompt engineering. We'll need to define a specific format in the system prompt that the LLM can use to *request* conversation retrieval (e.g.,  "To recall the full details of conversation #<conversation_id>, respond with the following special command: `[RECALL_CONVERSATION:<conversation_id>]`"). We'll then need to parse the model's response for this pattern in our code.

4.  **System Prompt Modification (`chat_utils.py`):**
    *   Update `create_system_prompt()` to:
        *   **Include Summaries as Context:**  Load all `conversation_*_summary.md` files from `project_info/conversations/`.  Include these summaries in the system prompt as initial context, clearly labeled (e.g., "Here are summaries of your past conversations for context: ...").
        *   **Describe the `remember_conversation` Tool:**  In the system prompt, describe the `remember_conversation` tool (or the `[RECALL_CONVERSATION:<conversation_id>]` command if simulating). Explain its purpose and how the AI should use it.  For example:
            ```
            You have access to summaries of previous conversations. Use these summaries to understand the general context of past discussions.

            If you need more detailed information from a specific past conversation to answer the user's current question, you can use the 'remember_conversation' tool.

            Tool: remember_conversation(conversation_id)
            Description: Retrieves the full content of a past conversation.
            Parameter: conversation_id (e.g., '14').

            Use this tool ONLY when the summaries are not sufficient and you are confident that reviewing the full conversation will provide the necessary details to answer the user's question effectively.  Do not use it unnecessarily.  Prioritize using the summaries and the current codebase context first.
            ```

**Phase 3: Tool Use Handling and UI Integration**

5.  **Tool Call Detection and Handling (`ChatWorker.py`):**
    *   Modify `ChatWorker.run()` to:
        *   **Check for Tool Calls in Response:** After receiving a response from the LLM, check if the response indicates a tool call (using the Gemini API's mechanism or by parsing for our `[RECALL_CONVERSATION:...]` pattern).
        *   **If `remember_conversation` Tool Called:**
            *   Extract the `conversation_id` from the tool call parameters (or parsed command).
            *   Retrieve the full content of the corresponding `conversation_<conversation_id>.md` file.
            *   **Re-invoke LLM with Full Conversation:**  Construct a new prompt. This new prompt should include:
                *   The *original* system prompt (including summaries).
                *   The *current user message*.
                *   The *full content* of the requested conversation (clearly labeled, e.g., "Full content of conversation #<conversation_id> requested by the AI: ...").
                *   Optionally, a short instruction to the LLM like, "You have requested and now been provided with the full content of conversation #<conversation_id>. Use this additional information, along with the summaries and codebase context, to answer the user's question."
            *   Send this new prompt to the LLM to get a *revised* response.
            *   Update `reply_text` with the *revised* response (the one generated *after* providing the full conversation).
        *   **If No Tool Call:** Proceed with the regular response processing (Markdown rendering, UI update).

6.  **UI Feedback (`ui.py`):**
    *   In `MainWindow.update_chat_display()`, when handling a response:
        *   If we detect that a "remember_conversation" tool call was made and we are now displaying the *revised* response (from the re-invocation of the LLM), add a visual indicator in the UI to inform the user (e.g., "AI recalled details from conversation #<conversation_id> to provide this answer.").  This could be a simple message prepended to the AI's response.

**Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**

7.  **Testing and Iteration:**  Thoroughly test the new memory management system:
    *   Have long conversations spanning multiple turns.
    *   Ask questions that might require recalling information from past conversations.
    *   Observe if and when the LLM uses the `remember_conversation` tool.
    *   Evaluate the quality of summaries and their effectiveness in guiding the LLM.
    *   Check for any performance issues or unexpected behavior.
    *   Refine prompts, tool descriptions, and implementation based on testing and observations.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Research Gemini API Tool Use:**  First and foremost, let's dive into the Google Gemini API documentation and examples to fully understand its tool use or function calling capabilities.  This will determine how we define and handle the `remember_conversation` tool.
2.  **Implement Summarization (Phase 1):** Start by implementing the conversation summarization function and the saving of summaries in `ui.py`. This is a foundational step regardless of how we handle tool use.
3.  **System Prompt Design (Phase 2):**  Design the system prompt, including the description of the `remember_conversation` tool (or the simulated command), and how summaries are presented.

This RAG-like approach is a more ambitious undertaking, but it has the potential to significantly improve InsightCoder's long-term conversational abilities and efficiency.  Let's start with Phase 1 and the Gemini API research and then proceed step by step. What are your thoughts on this detailed plan?
