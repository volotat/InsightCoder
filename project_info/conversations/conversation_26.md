# InsightCoder

**InsightCoder** is a tool engineered to provide AI-powered insights directly into your codebase. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), InsightCoder empowers you to ask natural language questions about your software projects and receive intelligent, context-aware answers directly in your terminal.

Initially developed as an AI-powered assistant to aid in the development of the [Anagnorisis project](https://github.com/volotat/Anagnorisis) (a local recommendation system), InsightCoder has grown into a versatile standalone tool for any software development endeavor.

**⚠️ Important Notice**: InsightCoder operates by sending your project's source code to an LLM service (like Google Gemini) for in-depth analysis. **To protect your privacy, rigorously ensure that your project folders and files DO NOT contain any personal, confidential, or sensitive information when using InsightCoder.**

## Core Features

*   **Deep Codebase Analysis via AI:** Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), InsightCoder provides a profound understanding of your codebase, going beyond keyword searches to analyze code logic and structure contextually.
*   **Large Context Window:** InsightCoder leverages the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model, currently chosen for its **extensive 1 million token context window**. This large context is crucial for processing potentially large project codebases in their entirety and maintaining conversation history.
*   **Real-time Token Counting:** A visual "Tokens: [count]" label displays the current token usage in the UI, helping you monitor context consumption.
*   **Intuitive Natural Language Queries:** Pose questions about your project in plain English and receive detailed, insightful responses.
*   **Holistic Project Context:** InsightCoder analyzes your entire project, including Git diff information for the most up-to-date and relevant answers regarding recent changes.
*   **Clean Markdown Output with Syntax Highlighting:** AI responses are presented in well-formatted Markdown, featuring syntax-highlighted code blocks for optimal readability and developer experience.
*   **Enhance Developer Workflow & Understanding:** Accelerate onboarding to new projects, quickly grasp complex logic, and streamline your development process with AI-powered assistance.
*   **Local Execution with Privacy in Mind:** Runs directly from your command line, ensuring your codebase data remains local and secure, only interacting with the LLM API during active query processing.
*   **Conversation History (Project Memory):** InsightCoder saves each conversation to a Markdown file in the configured conversations directory, providing persistent context for ongoing discussions. Conversations are loaded even if the folder is Git-ignored.
*   **Automated Diff Detection:** Automatically detects code diff blocks within AI responses, extracts file paths, and validates their existence in the project (preparatory step for automated application).

## InsightCoder vs. GitHub Copilot: Key Differentiators

**Understanding Context Window & Token Usage:** InsightCoder leverages a large context window (up to 2 million tokens) to analyze your entire codebase and conversation history. **Tokens** are units of text that LLMs process. The context window size limits the amount of text the AI can "remember" at once. By keeping conversation history and codebase context within this window, InsightCoder provides informed and consistent answers. You can monitor token usage in real-time in the UI to understand context consumption.

It's important to understand that **InsightCoder is not intended to replace tools like GitHub Copilot but rather to complement them.** They serve different primary purposes and excel in different areas. Here's a comparison:

| Feature             | InsightCoder                                  | GitHub Copilot                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Codebase Understanding & Insights              | Code Completion & Generation                     |
| **Context Scope**   | **Entire Project Codebase** (up to 2M token window) | Primarily Current File & Immediate Context      |
| **Analysis Focus**  | Project Architecture, Logic, Patterns          | Line-by-line Code, Snippets                     |
| **Query Type**      | Natural Language Questions about Codebase      | Code Context for Suggestions                    |
| **Conversation**    | Persistent Conversation History               | Contextual within Current Editing Session        |
| **Project Scope**   | **Any Git Repository** (Code, Docs, Books)    | Primarily Programming Code                      |
| **Tool Category**   | AI-Powered Codebase Analysis Tool             | AI Pair Programmer / Code Assistant             |

**InsightCoder excels at providing a holistic understanding of your project**, enabling you to ask broad questions and receive context-aware answers based on the entire codebase. It's designed for scenarios where you need to grasp the overall architecture, understand complex logic spanning multiple files, or onboard to a new project quickly.

**GitHub Copilot, on the other hand, shines in real-time code completion and suggestion within your editor.** It's incredibly efficient for speeding up code writing and generating repetitive code blocks.

**Think of them as complementary tools:**

*   **Use GitHub Copilot** for accelerating your daily coding tasks, writing code more efficiently line-by-line.
*   **Use InsightCoder** when you need to step back and understand the project as a whole, ask high-level questions, or explore unfamiliar codebases.

## Getting Started

**System Requirements:**

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   pip package installer

**Installation Guide:**

1.  **Clone the InsightCoder GitHub Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/volotat/InsightCoder
    cd InsightCoder
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Best Practice):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .env
    # Activate your virtual environment:
    # For Linux/macOS:
    source .env/bin/activate
    # For Windows:
    .env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Python Libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Your LLM API Key:**

    InsightCoder is currently configured to use the Google Gemini API. Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and set it as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key
    ```

## Analyzing a Specific Project Directory

To analyze a codebase in a directory other than the current one, use the `--project-path` or `-p` argument when running `ask.py`.

**Example:**

To analyze a project located at `/path/to/your/project`, run:

```bash
python ask.py -p /path/to/your/project
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to the project you want to analyze.

If you omit the `--project-path` argument, InsightCoder will analyze the codebase in the current directory where you run the ask.py script.

## Specifying a Custom Conversation Folder

By default, conversation history is saved in the project_info/conversations directory within your project. To specify a custom folder for saving conversations, use the `--conversation-path` or `-c` argument:
Example:
To save conversations in /path/to/your/custom/conversations_folder, run:
```bash
python ask.py -c /path/to/your/custom/conversations_folder
```

Replace `/path/to/your/custom/conversations_folder` with the actual path to your desired conversation folder.
If you omit the `--conversation-path` argument, conversations will be saved in the default `/path/to/your/project/project_info/conversations` directory.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Open your Terminal and Navigate to the InsightCoder directory:**

    ```bash
    cd InsightCoder
    ```

2.  **Execute the `ask.py` script to begin an interactive session:**

    ```bash
    python ask.py
    ```

3.  **Start Interacting with your Codebase using Natural Language Questions!**

    Type your questions directly into the command line prompt. InsightCoder will process your query, analyze your project's code, and present the AI-generated response directly in your terminal window.
