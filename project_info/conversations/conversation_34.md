For some reason the web window only takes a half of the space instead of all the space available to it.



**Model:**

Of course, I can help with that. It sounds like a classic layout management issue in PyQt. When you switched from `QTextBrowser` to `QWebEngineView`, the default way space is allocated in the vertical layout likely changed.

### The Cause

The problem is that the `QVBoxLayout` is dividing the available vertical space among its widgets (`QWebEngineView`, the token label, and the input area). Without explicit instructions, it often gives each widget a share of the space, which can result in the web view not expanding to fill the area as you'd expect. `QTextBrowser` might have a different default size policy that makes it expand automatically, which would explain why this issue appeared after the switch.

### The Solution

We can fix this by telling the `QVBoxLayout` to give all of the available "stretchable" space to the `QWebEngineView`. We do this by setting a "stretch factor" on the web view widget when we add it to the layout. This ensures it expands to fill any extra space, while the other widgets below it will only take up the minimum space they need.

Here is the minimal change required in `ask_src/ui.py`:

```python:ask_src/ui.py
        input_layout = QHBoxLayout()
        input_layout.addWidget(self.input_edit)
        input_layout.addWidget(self.send_button)

        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.web_view, 1) # Set stretch factor to 1 to take available space
        layout.addWidget(self.token_count_label) # Add token count label to layout
        layout.addLayout(input_layout)

        container = QWidget()
```

By changing `layout.addWidget(self.web_view)` to `layout.addWidget(self.web_view, 1)`, we assign a stretch factor of 1 to the web view. Since the other widgets have a default stretch factor of 0, the `QWebEngineView` will now be the only widget that expands vertically, solving the layout problem.

Also, now the code is not highlighted correcly in the window when rendering the markdown produced by the model



**Model:**

You've hit on a classic web development puzzle that often appears when moving between different rendering engines. The switch from `QTextBrowser`'s simpler renderer to `QWebEngineView`'s full Chromium engine means we need to be more precise about how we generate and style our HTML.

The issue likely stems from a combination of how the `markdown` library is being called and how the CSS is structured. Here's a two-part solution to make the highlighting robust.

### 1. Make Markdown Generation More Explicit

First, we'll update how we call the `markdown` library. By just passing extension names as strings, we rely on their default configurations, which can sometimes be ambiguous or change between versions. Using the `extension_configs` parameter makes our intent clear. We will explicitly tell the `codehilite` extension not to guess the language, making it more predictable.

I'll apply this to the two places where markdown is converted to HTML.

### 2. Improve the CSS for Code Blocks

Second, the custom styling for the code block container in `pygments_default.css` can be improved. The current rule `pre, .codehilite` applies the same styles to both the outer `div` and the inner `<pre>` tag, which can sometimes cause rendering inconsistencies in a standards-compliant browser.

We'll make this more specific: we'll style the `.codehilite` container and then separately style the `<pre>` tag inside it. This is better practice and removes any ambiguity for the rendering engine.

### Code Changes

Here are the required changes for the files.

#### 1. `ask_src/worker.py` (Update Markdown call)

We'll add `extension_configs` to the `markdown.markdown()` calls in the chat worker.

```python:ask_src/worker.py
//...
        try:
            response = self.chat.send_message_stream(self.message)
            print("response", response)
            for chunk in response:
                reply_text += chunk.text if chunk.text is not None else ""
                updated_md = history + f"\n\n**Model:**\n\n{reply_text}\n\n"
                updated_html = markdown.markdown(
                    updated_md,
                    extensions=["fenced_code", "codehilite", "nl2br"],
                    extension_configs={'codehilite': {'guess_lang': False}}
                )
                self.callback_signal.emit(updated_html, False, "")
            final_md = history + f"\n\n**Model:**\n\n{reply_text}\n\n"
            final_html = markdown.markdown(
                final_md,
                extensions=["fenced_code", "codehilite", "nl2br"],
                extension_configs={'codehilite': {'guess_lang': False}}
            )

            diff_blocks = detect_diff_blocks(final_md) # Call detect_diff_blocks to get a list of dictionaries
//...
```

#### 2. `ask_src/ui.py` (Update Markdown calls)

We'll do the same for the markdown conversions in the UI file.

```python:ask_src/ui.py
//...
        # Set initial content (the welcome page)
        initial_html_body = markdown.markdown(
            self.chat_history,
            extensions=["fenced_code", "codehilite", "nl2br"],
            extension_configs={'codehilite': {'guess_lang': False}}
        )
        self.update_chat_display(initial_html_body, False, "") # Use the update method to apply styles

        self.input_edit = EnterTextEdit()
//...
//...
    def send_message(self):
        user_msg = self.input_edit.toPlainText().strip()
        if not user_msg:
            return

        # If this is the first message, clear the welcome screen.
        if not self.conversation_started:
            self.chat_history = ""
            self.conversation_started = True

        self.input_edit.clear()
        self.chat_history += f"\n\n**User:**\n\n{user_msg}\n\n"
        html_body = markdown.markdown(
            self.chat_history,
            extensions=["fenced_code", "codehilite", "nl2br"],
            extension_configs={'codehilite': {'guess_lang': False}}
        )
        self.update_chat_display(html_body, False, "")

        worker = ChatWorker(user_msg, self.chat_history, self.chat_signals.update_text, self.chat, self.project_path)
        worker.start()
//...
```

#### 3. `ask_src/pygments_default.css` (Update CSS rule)

Finally, let's update the custom styles at the end of the CSS file.

```css:ask_src/pygments_default.css
//...
.vi { color: #19177C } /* Name.Variable.Instance */
.vm { color: #19177C } /* Name.Variable.Magic */
.il { color: #666666 } /* Literal.Number.Integer.Long */

.codehilite {
    background-color: #f8f8f2; /* Slightly grey-beige */
    border: 1px solid #ccc;    /* Thin border */
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    overflow: auto;
}

.codehilite pre {
    line-height: 100%;  /* Reduce extra spacing */
    margin: 0;          /* Remove extra margin */
}
```

These changes should resolve the syntax highlighting issue by making the HTML generation more explicit and the CSS styling more precise for the `QWebEngineView` renderer.
