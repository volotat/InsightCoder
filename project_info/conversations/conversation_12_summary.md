The user asked how to display the token count of their input message in real-time while typing. The AI proposed adding a dynamic token count label to the UI. The solution involves:
*   Adding a `QLabel` widget to the UI layout.
*   Connecting the `textChanged` signal of the input text edit to a new method (`update_token_count_display`).
*   Implementing this method to get the current text, call the API client's `count_tokens` method, and update the label with the result.
