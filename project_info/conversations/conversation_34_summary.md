The user reported that their `QWebEngineView` (web window) was only taking half of the available space. The AI diagnosed this as a PyQt layout management issue, specifically that the `QVBoxLayout` was distributing space equally among widgets instead of allowing the web view to expand. The suggested solution was to set a stretch factor of `1` for `self.web_view` when adding it to the layout (`layout.addWidget(self.web_view, 1)`), ensuring it takes all available vertical space.
