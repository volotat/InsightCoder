The conversation outlines the initial steps towards automated diff application in a codebase. Key points include:

*   **Initial Step:** Detect code diff blocks within the AI's responses.
*   **Refactoring:** The detection logic was moved from the main worker script (`worker.py`) into a dedicated, testable module (`diff_detector.py`).
*   **Improved Detection:** The method was refined to specifically look for the ` ```diff ` Markdown code fence for more robust detection, rather than just relying on line heuristics (`+`, `-`, `@`).
*   **Multiple Block Extraction:** The `diff_detector` module was further refactored to detect and return a list of *all* diff blocks present in the AI's response, rather than just checking for the presence of one.
*   **Integration:** The worker script was updated to use the refactored module and iterate through the list of detected diff blocks.
