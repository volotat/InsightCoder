This conversation focused on separating the `ask.py` script into a new open-source project.

Key points:
*   The user requested a name and a `readme.md` draft for the new project.
*   The AI initially suggested "CodeQuery" and provided a `readme.md`.
*   Upon the user noting a name conflict, the AI proposed alternatives, recommending "InsightCoder", and provided a revised `readme.md`.
*   The user requested specific `readme` edits: removing a previous note, adding the project's origin (related to Anagnorisis), and mentioning potential future AI agent capabilities.
*   The AI delivered a final `readme.md` draft incorporating these changes.
*   The conversation concluded with the user initiating the project split and the AI confirming its readiness as the standalone "InsightCoder".
