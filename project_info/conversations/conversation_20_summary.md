Here's a summary of the conversation:

The user asked how to ensure conversation history is loaded into the AI's context, even if the conversation folder is in `.gitignore` or located elsewhere, while preventing duplication in the codebase context.

The AI initially proposed:
1.  A new function (`get_conversation_history_context`) to load conversation files directly.
2.  Excluding the conversation folder (`project_info/conversations`) from the main codebase gathering process.
3.  Adding the loaded history as a separate context section.

The user pointed out that the initial solution didn't handle the case where a custom conversation path is specified via command-line arguments.

The AI corrected its approach by modifying the relevant functions (`create_system_prompt`, `get_conversation_history_context`) to accept a `conversation_path` argument and use it if provided, falling back to the default path otherwise.
