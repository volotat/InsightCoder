# InsightCoder Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the InsightCoder project. It is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves and we gather community feedback.

## Short-Term Vision (Next Release - v0.1.2)

*   **Focus:**  Enhancing User Experience and Documentation.
*   **Target Timeline:** [Specify a timeframe, e.g., 1-2 weeks]

    *   **Documentation Improvements:**
        *   [ ] Expand "Example Prompts" section in `README.md` with more diverse and practical examples.
        *   [ ] Add a "Troubleshooting" section to `README.md` addressing common issues.
        *   [ ] Emphasize and clarify the "Privacy Warning" in `README.md`.
        *   [ ] **Crucial:** Add an Open-Source License (MIT License) - `LICENSE` file and text in `README.md`.
        *   [ ] Populate "Contributing" and "Support" sections in `README.md` with initial information.
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
        *   [ ] Implement a visual loading indicator in the UI during LLM query processing.
        *   [ ] Improve error handling and display more user-friendly error messages in the UI.
    *   **Code Cleanup and Minor Refactoring:**
        *   [ ] Review code and add more comments, especially in `chat_utils.py` and `ui.py`.
        *   [ ] Double-check and improve robustness of file path handling.

## Medium-Term Goals (Releases v0.1.3 - v0.2.x)

*   **Focus:**  Introducing AI Code Agent Capabilities and Deeper Code Understanding.
*   **Target Timeline:** [Specify a timeframe, e.g., Next 1-3 months]

    *   **Code Modification Suggestions (Initial Stage):**
        *   [ ] **Experiment:** Research and prototype the ability to suggest code refactoring opportunities based on AI analysis.  *(Initial focus: simple refactorings, e.g., function renaming, variable extraction)*.
        *   [ ] **UI Integration (Basic):**  Explore how to display refactoring suggestions in the UI (initially, perhaps as text output in the chat).
    *   **Improved Contextual Awareness:**
        *   [ ] **Research:** Investigate techniques for deeper code structure understanding (static analysis, code parsing libraries).
        *   [ ] **Symbol Understanding (Initial):** Enhance AI's ability to understand basic code symbols (functions, classes) within a file.
    *   **Conversation History Management:**
        *   [ ] Implement a basic UI element to list saved conversations for easier access.

## Long-Term Vision (v0.3.x and beyond)

*   **Focus:**  Evolving into a Proactive AI Code Agent, IDE Integration, and Advanced Features.
*   **Target Timeline:** [Specify timeframe, e.g., 6+ months and ongoing]

    *   **Automated Code Changes via Git Pushes (AI-Driven Development):**
        *   [ ] **Feasibility Study & Design:**  Thoroughly research and design the architecture for automated code changes via Git pushes.
        *   [ ] **Git Integration:** Implement Git functionality within InsightCoder to stage, commit, and push changes.
        *   [ ] **Authentication & Security:** Securely manage GitHub credentials and implement robust security measures to prevent unintended pushes.
        *   [ ] **User Review Workflow:** Design a workflow where AI-suggested changes are presented to the user for review and approval *before* Git push.
        *   [ ] **Automated Refactoring & Code Improvement:** Develop AI capabilities to proactively identify and suggest code improvements, refactorings, and potentially even generate new code snippets, automatically creating Git commits for these suggestions.
    *   **IDE/Editor Integration:**
        *   [ ] Explore and begin development of plugins/extensions for popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
    *   **Advanced Features:**
        *   [ ] Project "Personality" and Customization (project-specific prompts, persona definition).
        *   [ ] Continuous Code Monitoring and Real-time Insights.
        *   [ ] Support for more LLMs.

*This roadmap is subject to change and will be updated periodically based on progress, community feedback, and new opportunities.*
